# Nashville Historic Markers
This is a group project where we will be building an application around [open data](https://data.nashville.gov) about historical markers provided by the Nashville Metro government. 

**Working Title:** HistoriCrawl.

This will be a long-running series where we incrementally build a mobile application together. Each lesson will attempt to address a topic in a way that adds or improves functionality in our mobile application.

### What You Need To Know

**Absolutely no prior experience is required.** Come excited and with all of your questions.

Each lesson will be followed up by a walkthrough doc for those who aren't able to join the group. Each walkthrough will attempt to provide examples for Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, and Xamarin.Forms. 

_Because of time constraints, examples in class will focus on one platform. However, questions for additional platforms are welcome and will be answered as thoroughly as possible._

### Topics We Plan To Cover
1. Installing Xamarin
2. Building a List
3. Advanced List Topics
5. Interacting with Maps
6. User Experience / Design
7. Share on (Twitter / Instagram)
7. Interacting with a public API
8. Geolocation
9. Text-to-Speech
10. Wearable support and more...

**No paid license is required.** If you already have a Xamarin license -- Great! If you do not have a license, join the group each month, and we will pair you with someone who does. 

The first few lessons will be structured in a way that supports the free [Xamarin Starter Edition](http://xamarin.com/starter). To build beyond that, each person will either need a [purchased license](https://store.xamarin.com/), a valid [trial](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/beginning_a_xamarin_trial/), or to be paired with someone who does.
